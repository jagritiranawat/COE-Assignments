    "Properties of the Normal Distribution\n",

    "\n",
    "Symmetry:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Normal distribution is symmetric about its mean μ. This means that the left side of the distribution is a mirror image of the right side.\n",
    "Bell-Shaped Curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability density function (PDF) of a Normal distribution forms a bell-shaped curve. The highest point on the curve corresponds to the mean μ.\n",
    "Mean, Median, and Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation σ determines the spread of the distribution. A smaller 𝜎 results in a steeper curve, while a larger 𝜎results in a flatter curve.\n",
    "68-95-99.7 Rule (Empirical Rule):\n",
    "\n",
    "About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (μ±σ) of the mean.\n",
    "About 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations (μ±2σ) of the mean.\n",
    "About 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations (μ±3σ) of the mean.\n",
    "Asymptotic:\n",
    "\n",
    "The tails of the Normal distribution extend infinitely in both directions and approach, but never touch, the horizontal axis.\n",
    "Defined by Mean and Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Normal distribution is completely defined by its mean 𝜇 and standard deviation σ.\n",
    "Applications of the Normal Distribution\n",
    "The Normal distribution has numerous applications across various fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many statistical tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, are based on the assumption that the data follows a Normal distribution.\n",
    "Central Limit Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables tends to follow a Normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.\n",
    "Quality Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "In manufacturing, the Normal distribution is used in quality control processes to monitor whether products meet certain specifications.\n",
